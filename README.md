# Project 1 : Road Accident Risk Analytics for Motor Insurance & Risk Reduction

## Executive Summary
- Identified high-risk accident zones with spatial clustering to inform underwriting decisions
- Mapped accident severity trends by location and time of day
- Produced actionable insights to support geo-risk pricing strategy and loss mitigation

## Business Questions
- Where are the true accident risk hotspots?
- What structural or behavioral factors drive claim severity?
- How can insurers reduce loss through targeted interventions?

## Data Overview
- Motor insurance claim data (2023–2025)
- Accident location (GPS)
- Vehicle type, time, claim severity

## Analytical Approach
1. Claim frequency and severity analysis
2. Spatial clustering and hotspot detection
3. Micro-location investigation using map and street view
4. Root cause classification
5. Risk treatment and business recommendations

## Key Insights
- Top 2 hotspots account for ~12% of total claims in the province
- U-turn areas without traffic signals show 1.6x higher claim severity
- Night-time accidents have lower frequency but significantly higher severity

## Tools
Python, Pandas, GeoPandas, Folium, Google Maps API / ArcGIS

## Area for geospatial analysis
Pilot analysis for 10 provinces in Thailand, Started from Chacheonsao, Ubonratchatani, Korat etc.

## Business Implications
- Underwriting: define geo-risk zones
- Pricing strategy: adjust for severity trends
- Loss prevention: enable targeted interventions
- Product roadmap: support data-driven decisions for motor portfolio
