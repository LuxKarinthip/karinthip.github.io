# Project 1 #Road Accident Risk Analytics for Motor Insurance

## Business Context
Motor insurance claims show persistently high loss ratios in certain locations, 
but traditional reporting lacks spatial and root-cause insights to guide 
underwriting and risk prevention decisions.

## Business Questions
- Where are the true accident risk hotspots?
- What structural or behavioral factors drive claim severity?
- How can insurers reduce loss through targeted interventions?

## Data Overview
- Motor insurance claim data (2023–2025)
- Accident location (GPS)
- Vehicle type, time, claim severity

## Analytical Approach
1. Claim frequency and severity analysis
2. Spatial clustering and hotspot detection
3. Micro-location investigation using map and street view
4. Root cause classification
5. Risk treatment and business recommendations

## Key Insights
- Top 2 hotspots account for ~12% of total claims in the province
- U-turn areas without traffic signals show 1.6x higher claim severity
- Night-time accidents have lower frequency but significantly higher severity

## Business Implications
- Enable geo-based risk zoning for underwriting
- Support selective pricing and deductible policies
- Provide evidence-based recommendations for loss prevention

## Tools
Python, Pandas, GeoPandas, Folium, Google Maps API
